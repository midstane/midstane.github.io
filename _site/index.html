      <p>This is a love letter</p>

<p>(that’s probably long overdue)</p>

<p> </p>

<p>When I thought about a moment like this,</p>

<p>(I usually don’t but when I do)</p>

<p>I thought about maybe some families and friends,</p>

<p>Or some movies and songs</p>

<p>You know, possibilities</p>

<p> </p>

<p>But nothing really matters after all if you really think about it</p>

<p>Nothing really matters when it is you</p>

<p>That I think about</p>

<p> </p>

<p>No crowds or flowers</p>

<p>Just you and me</p>

<p>(And maybe a little windy)</p>

<p>Right here</p>

<p>Right now</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Dear Nat</p>

<p>It’s been an incredible 3 years, well over 1000 days</p>

<p>Not a single day of which passed that I wasn’t glad I have you with me</p>

<p>Even during the difficulties or fights</p>

<p>Especially during the difficulties or fights</p>

<p>( that’s not to say I want more fights, just so we are clear…)</p>

<p> </p>

<p>As cliché as it may sound</p>

<p>I become a better version of myself</p>

<p>To families, to strangers, to life, to the future, and of course, to puppies 🐶</p>

<p>I was all alone for so many years</p>

<p>Until you showed up and provided partnership</p>

<p>(Which started as relationship but then evolved to have included friendship and mentorship)</p>

<p> </p>

<p>There were days I was hesitant but you were patient</p>

<p>There were days I was afraid but you waited</p>

<p> </p>

<p>It was like AirPods or retina displays</p>

<p>You didn’t know you need it until you had it</p>

<p>And then you can never live without it</p>

<p>Can you imagine a life without retina displays?</p>

<p>That life would be incomplete</p>

<p> </p>

<p>So before a lover letter,</p>

<p>This is also a thank you letter</p>

<p>Thanks for all the days and nights</p>

<p>Thanks for all the laughters and tears</p>

<p>Thanks for all the arguments and complains</p>

<p>Thanks for all the trusts and hugs</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Dear Nat</p>

<p>There will be a lot more 3 years</p>

<p>There would be a lot uncertainties</p>

<p>But I want it to be certain</p>

<p> </p>

<p>If I am to go to more beaches, I want to go to the beaches with you</p>

<p>Like what we did in Vietnam</p>

<p>If I am to go to more hot springs, I want to go to hot springs with you</p>

<p>Like what we did in Japan</p>

<p>If I am to watch more fireworks, I want to watch fireworks with you</p>

<p>Like what we did in Hong Kong</p>

<p>If I am to go to more amusement parks, I want to go to parks with you</p>

<p>Like what we did in Singapore</p>

<p>If I am to take more trains, I want to take trains with you</p>

<p>Like what we did in Italy</p>

<p>If I am to have more McDonald, I want to have McDonald with you</p>

<p>Like what we did yesterday in Time Square</p>

<p>If I am to watch more museums, I want to watch museums with you</p>

<p>Like what we did today in The Met</p>

<p>If I am to spend more quality time with families, I want to spend the time with you</p>

<p>Like what we did in Fremont Cali</p>

<p> </p>

<p>If</p>

<p>I am to spend the life with someone</p>

<p>I want to spend the life with you</p>

<p>Like what we did in the past 3 years</p>

<p> </p>

<p>If you have to quote Shakespeare in a love letter</p>

<p>Here is how I would quote him now</p>

<p>I would not wish any companion in the world but you</p>

<p> </p>

<p>3 years ago</p>

<p>You said something to me</p>

<p>You said something</p>

<p>That blew me away</p>

<p>That I told myself I shall never forget</p>

<p>That 3 years later at this very moment I want to say to you</p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><em>Today, you are the one I want to spend the life with</em></strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p>I love you</p>

<p>I love you more than the egos and paranoids I have</p>

<p>I love you more than the difficulties and fights we will have</p>

<p>I love you because I am a better person when I’m with you</p>

<p>I love you because I want to</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I want to learn to cook</p>

<p>I want to learn to drive</p>

<p>I want to learn to be a better man in my life</p>

<p>I want to learn to be a better man in your life</p>

<p>I want to learn to better love you</p>

<p>I want to learn to continue to love you</p>

<p>So please</p>

<p>Please let me</p>

<p><img src="/IMAGE-1.JPG" alt="" />
<img src="/IMAGE.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>So</p>

<p>Here is the question…</p>
