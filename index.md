This is a love letter

(that‚Äôs probably long overdue)

&nbsp;

When I thought about a moment like this,

(I usually don‚Äôt but when I do)

I thought about maybe some families and friends,

Or some movies and songs

You know, possibilities

&nbsp;

But nothing really matters after all if you really think about it

Nothing really matters when it is you

That I think about

&nbsp;

No crowds or flowers

Just you and me

(And maybe a little windy)

Right here

Right now

&nbsp;

Dear Nat

It‚Äôs been an incredible 3 years, well over 1000 days

Not a single day of which passed that I wasn‚Äôt glad I have you with me

Even during the difficulties or fights

Especially during the difficulties or fights

( that‚Äôs not to say I want more fights, just so we are clear‚Ä¶)

&nbsp;

As clich√© as it may sound

I become a better version of myself

To families, to strangers, to life, to the future, and of course, to puppies üê∂

I was all alone for so many years

Until you showed up and provided partnership

(Which started as relationship but then evolved to have included friendship and mentorship)

&nbsp;

There were days I was hesitant but you were patient

There were days I was afraid but you waited

&nbsp;

It was like AirPods or retina displays

You didn‚Äôt know you need it until you had it

And then you can never live without it

Can you imagine a life without retina displays?

That life would be incomplete

&nbsp;

So before a lover letter,

This is also a thank you letter

Thanks for all the days and nights

Thanks for all the laughters and tears

Thanks for all the arguments and complains

Thanks for all the trusts and hugs

Thanks

&nbsp;

Dear Nat

There will be a lot more 3 years

There would be a lot uncertainties

But I want it to be certain

&nbsp;

If I am to go to more beaches, I want to go to the beaches with you

Like what we did in Vietnam

If I am to go to more hot springs, I want to go to hot springs with you

Like what we did in Japan

If I am to watch more fireworks, I want to watch fireworks with you

Like what we did in Hong Kong

If I am to go to more amusement parks, I want to go to parks with you

Like what we did in Singapore

If I am to take more trains, I want to take trains with you

Like what we did in Italy

If I am to have more McDonald, I want to have McDonald with you

Like what we did yesterday in Time Square

If I am to watch more museums, I want to watch museums with you

Like what we did today in The Met

If I am to spend more quality time with families, I want to spend the time with you

Like what we did in Fremont Cali

&nbsp;

If

I am to spend the life with someone

I want to spend the life with you

Like what we did in the past 3 years

&nbsp;

If you have to quote Shakespeare in a love letter

Here is how I would quote him now

I would not wish any companion in the world but you

&nbsp;

3 years ago

You said something to me

You said something

That blew me away

That I told myself I shall never forget

That 3 years later at this very moment I want to say to you

&nbsp;

**_Today, you are the one I want to spend the life with_**

&nbsp;

I love you

I love you more than the egos and paranoids I have

I love you more than the difficulties and fights we will have

I love you because I am a better person when I‚Äôm with you

I love you because I want to

&nbsp;

I want to learn to cook

I want to learn to drive

I want to learn to be a better man in my life

I want to learn to be a better man in your life

I want to learn to better love you

I want to learn to continue to love you

So please

Please let me

Here is the question‚Ä¶
